Centrifugal force is the apparent force that acts outward on a body moving in a curved path. In this animation, we'll visualize this concept using a simple example. Here, we have a circle representing the path of an object. The object, shown as a red dot, moves along this circular path. A yellow line represents the radius of the circle. As the object moves, the radius line rotates with it. Now, we introduce an arrow representing the centrifugal force, which acts outward from the center of the circle. This force is what causes the object to move in a curved path. As the object continues to move along the circle, the centrifugal force arrow adjusts its direction to always point outward. This demonstrates that centrifugal force acts outward on a rotating object.
